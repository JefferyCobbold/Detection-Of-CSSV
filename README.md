Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus (CSSV) Detection using TinyML

Project Overview

This project implements a real-time, low-cost, and portable diagnostic tool for the early detection of the Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus (CSSV) using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML).
By deploying a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model onto an ESP32-CAM edge device, this system provides cocoa farmers and agricultural personnel with an immediate, on-site assessment of tree infection status.
The goal is to provide a rapid alternative to traditional lab-based testing, facilitating quicker quarantine and removal of infected plants to protect cocoa yields.
